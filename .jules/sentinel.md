## 2024-05-16 - DOM-based XSS in Admin Dashboard
**Vulnerability:** Found a DOM-based XSS vulnerability in `admin.js` where `error.message` was directly interpolated into `tbody.innerHTML`.
**Learning:** Even internal admin tools handling potential API errors need sanitization, as compromised API responses could inject malicious scripts.
**Prevention:** Always use `document.createElement()` combined with `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` when rendering dynamic data or error messages.
